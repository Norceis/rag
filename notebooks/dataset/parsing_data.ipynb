      "\n",
      "1. The Standardization Process\n",
      "\n",
      "The Internet Architecture Board maintains this list of documents that define standards for the Internet protocol suite. See RFC-1601 for the charter of the IAB and RFC-1160 for an explanation of the role and organization of the IAB and its subsidiary groups, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF). Each of these groups has a steering group called the IESG and IRSG, respectively. The IETF develops these standards with the goal of co-ordinating the evolution of the Internet protocols; this co-ordination has become quite important as the Internet protocols are increasingly in general commercial use. The definitive description of the Internet standards process is found in RFC-1602.\n",
      "\n",
      "The majority of Internet protocol development and standardization activity takes place in the working groups of the IETF.\n",
      "\n",
      "Protocols which are to become standards in the Internet go through a series of states or maturity levels (proposed standard, draft standard, and standard) involving increasing amounts of scrutiny and testing. When a protocol completes this process it is assigned a STD number (see RFC-1311). At each step, the Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG) of the IETF must make a recommendation for advancement of the protocol.\n",
      "\n",
      "To allow time for the Internet community to consider and react to standardization proposals, a minimum delay of 6 months before a proposed standard can be advanced to a draft standard and 4 months before a draft standard can be promoted to standard.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is general practice that no proposed standard can be promoted to draft standard without at least two independent implementations (and the recommendation of the IESG). Promotion from draft standard to standard generally requires operational experience and demonstrated interoperability of two or more implementations (and the recommendation of the IESG).\n",
      "\n",
      "In cases where there is uncertainty as to the proper decision concerning a protocol a special review committee may be appointed consisting of experts from the IETF, IRTF and the IAB with the purpose of recommending an explicit action.\n",
      "\n",
      "Advancement of a protocol to proposed standard is an important step since it marks a protocol as a candidate for eventual standardization (it puts the protocol \"on the standards track\"). Advancement to draft standard is a major step which warns the community that, unless major objections are raised or flaws are discovered, the protocol is likely to be advanced to standard in six months.\n",
      "\n",
      "Internet Architecture Board                                     [Page 3]\n",
      "\n",
      "RFC 1720                   Internet Standards              November 1994\n",
      "\n",
      "Some protocols have been superseded by better ones or are otherwise unused. Such protocols are still documented in this memorandum with the designation \"historic\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Because it is useful to document the results of early protocol research and development work, some of the RFCs document protocols which are still in an experimental condition. The protocols are designated \"experimental\" in this memorandum. They appear in this report as a convenience to the community and not as evidence of their standardization.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other protocols, such as those developed by other standards organizations, or by particular vendors, may be of interest or may be recommended for use in the Internet. The specifications of such protocols may be published as RFCs for the convenience of the Internet community. These protocols are labeled \"informational\" in this memorandum.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to the working groups of the IETF, protocol development and experimentation may take place as a result of the work of the research groups of the Internet Research Task Force, or the work of other individuals interested in Internet protocol development. The the documentation of such experimental work in the RFC series is encouraged, but none of this work is considered to be on the track for standardization until the IESG has made a recommendation to advance the protocol to the proposed standard state.\n",
      "\n",
      "A few protocols have achieved widespread implementation without the approval of the IESG. For example, some vendor protocols have become very important to the Internet community even though they have not been recommended by the IESG. However, the IAB strongly recommends that the standards process be used in the evolution of the protocol suite to maximize interoperability (and to prevent incompatible protocol requirements from arising). The use of the terms \"standard\", \"draft standard\", and \"proposed standard\" are reserved in any RFC or other publication of Internet protocols to only those protocols which the IESG has approved.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to a state (like \"Proposed Standard\"), a protocol is also assigned a status, or requirement level, in this document. The possible requirement levels (\"Required\", \"Recommended\", \"Elective\", \"Limited Use\", and \"Not Recommended\") are defined in Section 4.2. When a protocol is on the standards track, that is in the proposed standard, draft standard, or standard state (see Section 5), the status shown in Section 6 is the current status.\n",
      "\n",
      "Few protocols are required to be implemented in all systems; this is because there is such a variety of possible systems, for example,\n",
      "\n",

      "gateways, routers, terminal servers, workstations, and multi-user hosts. The requirement level shown in this document is only a one word label, which may not be sufficient to characterize the implementation requirements for a protocol in all situations. For some protocols, this document contains an additional status paragraph (an applicability statement). In addition, more detailed status information may be contained in separate requirements documents (see Section 3).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The Request for Comments Documents\n",
      "\n",
      "The documents called Request for Comments (or RFCs) are the working notes of the \"Network Working Group\", that is the Internet research and development community. A document in this series may be on essentially any topic related to computer communication, and may be anything from a meeting report to the specification of a standard.\n",

      "\n",
      "IGMP -- The Internet Architecture Board intends to move towards general adoption of IP multicasting, as a more efficient solution than broadcasting for many applications. The host interface has been standardized in RFC-1112; however, multicast-routing gateways are in the experimental stage and are not widely available. An Internet host should support all of RFC-1112, except for the IGMP protocol itself which is optional; see RFC-1122 for more details. Even without IGMP, implementation of RFC-1112 will provide an important advance: IP-layer access to local network multicast addressing. It is expected that IGMP will become recommended for all hosts and gateways at some future date.\n",
      "\n",
      "SMI, MIB-II SNMP -- The Internet Architecture Board recommends that all IP and TCP implementations be network manageable. At the current time, this implies implementation of the Internet MIB-II (RFC-1213), and at least the recommended management protocol SNMP (RFC-1157).\n",
      "\n",
      "RIP -- The Routing Information Protocol (RIP) is widely implemented and used in the Internet. However, both implementors and users should be aware that RIP has some serious technical limitations as a routing protocol. The IETF is currently developing several candidates for a new standard \"open\" routing protocol with better properties than RIP. The IAB urges the Internet community to track these developments, and to implement the new protocol when it is standardized; improved Internet service will result for many users.\n",
      "\n",
      "TP-TCP -- As OSI protocols become more widely implemented and used, there will be an increasing need to support interoperation with the TCP/IP protocols. The Internet Engineering Task Force is formulating strategies for interoperation. RFC-1006 provides one interoperation mode, in which TCP/IP is used to emulate TP0 in order to support OSI applications. Hosts that wish to run OSI connection-oriented applications in this mode should use the procedure described in RFC- 1006. In the future, the IAB expects that a major portion of the Internet will support both TCP/IP and OSI (inter-)network protocols in parallel, and it will then be possible to run OSI applications across the Internet using full OSI protocol \"stacks\".\n",

      "(IRTF).  Each of these groups has a steering group called the IESG\n",
      "and IRSG, respectively.  The IETF develops these standards with the\n",
      "goal of co-ordinating the evolution of the Internet protocols; this\n",
      "co-ordination has become quite important as the Internet protocols\n",
      "are increasingly in general commercial use.  The definitive\n",
      "description of the Internet standards process is found in RFC-1602.\n",
      "\n",
      "The majority of Internet protocol development and standardization\n",
      "activity takes place in the working groups of the IETF.\n",
      "\n",
      "Protocols which are to become standards in the Internet go through a\n",
      "series of states or maturity levels (proposed standard, draft\n",
      "standard, and standard) involving increasing amounts of scrutiny and\n",
      "testing.  When a protocol completes this process it is assigned a STD\n",

      "before a draft standard can be promoted to standard.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is general practice that no proposed standard can be promoted to\n",
      "draft standard without at least two independent implementations (and\n",
      "the recommendation of the IESG).  Promotion from draft standard to\n",
      "standard generally requires operational experience and demonstrated\n",

Finally are pointers to references and contacts forfurther information.This memo is intended to be issued approximately quarterly; please besure the copy you are reading is current. Current copies may beobtained from the Network Information Center (INTERNIC) or from theInternet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) (see the contactinformation at the end of this memo). Do not use this edition after1-Mar-95.See Section 6.1 for a description of recent changes. In the officiallists in sections 6.2 - 6.10, an asterisk (*) next to a protocoldenotes that it is new to this document or has been moved from oneprotocol level to another, or differs from the previous edition ofthis document.1. The Standardization ProcessThe Internet Architecture Board maintains this list of documents thatdefine standards for the Internet protocol suite. See RFC-1601 forthe charter of the IAB and RFC-1160 for an explanation of the roleand organization of the IAB and its subsidiary groups, the InternetEngineering Task Force (IETF) and the Internet Research Task Force(IRTF). Each of these groups has a steering group called the IESGand IRSG, respectively. The IETF develops these standards with thegoal of co-ordinating the evolution of the Internet protocols; thisco-ordination has become quite important as the Internet protocolsare increasingly in general commercial use. The definitivedescription of the Internet standards process is found in RFC-1602.The majority of Internet protocol development and standardizationactivity takes place in the working groups of the IETF.Protocols which are to become standards in the Internet go through aseries of states or maturity levels (proposed standard, draftstandard, and standard) involving increasing amounts of scrutiny andtesting. When a protocol completes this process it is assigned a STDnumber (see RFC-1311). At each step, the Internet EngineeringSteering Group (IESG) of the IETF must make a recommendation foradvancement of the protocol.To allow time for the Internet community to consider and react tostandardization proposals, a minimum delay of 6 months before aproposed standard can be advanced to a draft standard and 4 monthsbefore a draft standard can be promoted to standard.It is general practice that no proposed standard can be promoted todraft standard without at least two independent implementations (andthe recommendation of the IESG). Promotion from draft standard tostandard generally requires operational experience and demonstratedinteroperability of two or more implementations (and therecommendation of the IESG).In cases where there is uncertainty as to the proper decisionconcerning a protocol a special review committee may be appointedconsisting of experts from the IETF, IRTF and the IAB with thepurpose of recommending an explicit action.Advancement of a protocol to proposed standard is an important stepsince it marks a protocol as a candidate for eventual standardization(it puts the protocol \"on the standards track\"). Advancement todraft standard is a major step which warns the community that, unlessmajor objections are raised or flaws are discovered, the protocol islikely to be advanced to standard in six months.Some protocols have been superseded by better ones or are otherwiseunused. Such protocols are still documented in this memorandum withthe designation \"historic\".Because it is useful to document the results of early protocolresearch and development work, some of the RFCs document protocolswhich are still in an experimental condition. The protocols aredesignated \"experimental\" in this memorandum. They appear in thisreport as a convenience to the community and not as evidence of theirstandardization.Other protocols, such as those developed by other standardsorganizations, or by particular vendors, may be of interest or may berecommended for use in the Internet. The specifications of suchprotocols may be published as RFCs for the convenience of theInternet community. These protocols are labeled \"informational\" inthis memorandum.In addition to the working groups of the IETF, protocol developmentand experimentation may take place as a result of the work of theresearch groups of the Internet Research Task Force, or the work ofother individuals interested in Internet protocol development. Thethe documentation of such experimental work in the RFC series isencouraged, but none of this work is considered to be on the trackfor standardization until the IESG has made a recommendation toadvance the protocol to the proposed standard state.A few protocols have achieved widespread implementation without theapproval of the IESG. For example, some vendor protocols have becomevery important to the Internet community even though they have notbeen recommended by the IESG. However, the IAB strongly recommendsthat the standards process be used in the evolution of the protocolsuite to maximize interoperability (and to prevent incompatibleprotocol requirements from arising). The use of the terms\"standard\", \"draft standard\", and \"proposed standard\" are reserved inany RFC or other publication of Internet protocols to only thoseprotocols which the IESG has approved.In addition to a state (like \"Proposed Standard\"), a protocol is alsoassigned a status, or requirement level, in this document. Thepossible requirement levels (\"Required\", \"Recommended\", \"Elective\",\"Limited Use\", and \"Not Recommended\") are defined in Section 4.2.When a protocol is on the standards track, that is in the proposedstandard, draft standard, or standard state (see Section 5), thestatus shown in Section 6 is the current status.Few protocols are required to be implemented in all systems; this isbecause there is such a variety of possible systems, for example,gateways, routers, terminal servers, workstations, and multi-userhosts. The requirement level shown in this document is only a oneword label, which may not be sufficient to characterize theimplementation requirements for a protocol in all situations. Forsome protocols, this document contains an additional status paragraph(an applicability statement). In addition, more detailed statusinformation may be contained in separate requirements documents (seeSection 3).2. The Request for Comments DocumentsThe documents called Request for Comments (or RFCs) are the workingnotes of the \"Network Working Group\", that is the Internet researchand development community. A document in this series may be onessentially any topic related to computer communication, and may beanything from a meeting report to the specification of a standard.Notice:All standards are published as RFCs, but not all RFCs specifystandards.Anyone can submit a document for publication as an RFC. Submissionsmust be made via electronic mail to the RFC Editor (see the contactinformation at the end of this memo, and see RFC 1543).While RFCs are not refereed publications, they do receive technicalreview from the task forces, individual technical experts, or the RFCEditor, as appropriate.The RFC series comprises a wide range of documents, ranging frominformational documents of general interests to specifications ofstandard Internet protocols. In cases where submission is intendedto document a proposed standard, draft standard, or standardprotocol, the RFC Editor will publish the document only with theapproval of the IESG. For documents describing experimental work,the RFC Editor will notify the IESG before publication, allowing forthe possibility of review by the relevant IETF working group or IRTFresearch group and provide those comments to the author. See Section5.1 for more detail.Once a document is assigned an RFC number and published, that RFC isnever revised or re-issued with the same number. There is never aquestion of having the most recent version of a particular RFC.However, a protocol (such as File Transfer Protocol (FTP)) may beimproved and re-documented many times in several different RFCs. Itis important to verify that you have the most recent RFC on aparticular protocol. This \"Internet Official Protocol Standards\"memo is the reference for determining the correct RFC for the currentspecification of each protocol.The RFCs are available from the INTERNIC, and a number of othersites. For more information about obtaining RFCs, see Sections 7.4and 7.5.3. Other Reference DocumentsThere are three other reference documents of interest in checking thecurrent status of protocol specifications and standardization. Theseare the Assigned Numbers, the Gateway Requirements, and the HostRequirements. Note that these documents are revised and updated atdifferent times; in case of differences between these documents, themost recent must prevail.Also, one should be aware of the MIL-STD publications on IP, TCP,Telnet, FTP, and SMTP. These are described in Section 3.4.3.1. Assigned NumbersThe \"Assigned Numbers\" document lists the assigned values of theparameters used in the various protocols. For example, IP protocolcodes, TCP port numbers, Telnet Option Codes, ARP hardware types, andTerminal Type names. Assigned Numbers was most recently issued asRFC-1700.3.2. Gateway RequirementsThis document reviews the specifications that apply to gateways andsupplies guidance and clarification for any ambiguities. GatewayRequirements is RFC-1009. A working group of the IETF is activelypreparing a revision.3.3. Host RequirementsThis pair of documents reviews and updates the specifications thatapply to hosts, and it supplies guidance and clarification for anyambiguities. Host Requirements was issued as RFC-1122 and RFC-1123.3.4. The MIL-STD DocumentsThe Internet community specifications for IP (RFC-791) and TCP (RFC-793) and the DoD MIL-STD specifications are intended to describeexactly the same protocols. Any difference in the protocolsspecified by these sets of documents should be reported to DISA andto the IESG. The RFCs and the MIL-STDs for IP and TCP differ instyle and level of detail. It is strongly advised that the two setsof documents be used together, along with RFC-1122 and RFC-1123.The Internet and the DoD MIL-STD specifications for the FTP, SMTP,and Telnet protocols are essentially the same documents (RFCs 765,821, 854). The MIL-STD versions have been edited slightly. Notethat the current Internet specification for FTP is RFC-959 (asmodified by RFC-1123).Note that these MIL-STD are now somewhat out of date. The GatewayRequirements (RFC-1009) and Host Requirements (RFC-1122, RFC-1123)take precedence over both earlier RFCs and the MIL-STDs.Internet Protocol (IP) MIL-STD-1777Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) MIL-STD-1778File Transfer Protocol (FTP) MIL-STD-1780Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) MIL-STD-1781Telnet Protocol and Options (TELNET) MIL-STD-1782These documents are available from the Naval Publications and FormsCenter. Requests can be initiated by telephone, telegraph, or mail;however, it is preferred that private industry use form DD1425, ifpossible.Naval Publications and Forms Center, Code 30155801 Tabor AvePhiladelphia, PA 19120Phone: 1-215-697-3321 (order tape)1-215-697-4834 (conversation)4. Explanation of TermsThere are two independent categorization of protocols. The first isthe \"maturity level\" or STATE of standardization, one of \"standard\",\"draft standard\", \"proposed standard\", \"experimental\",\"informational\" or \"historic\". The second is the \"requirement level\"or STATUS of this protocol, one of \"required\", \"recommended\",\"elective\", \"limited use\", or \"not recommended\".The status or requirement level is difficult to portray in a one wordlabel. These status labels should be considered only as anindication, and a further description, or applicability statement,should be consulted.When a protocol is advanced to proposed standard or draft standard,it is labeled with a current status.At any given time a protocol occupies a cell of the following matrix.Protocols are likely to be in cells in about the followingproportions (indicated by the relative number of Xs). A new protocolis most likely to start in the (proposed standard, elective) cell, orthe (experimental, not recommended) cell.S T A T U SReq Rec Ele Lim Not+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+Std | X | XXX | XXX | | |S +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+Draft | X | X | XXX | | |T +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+Prop | | X | XXX | | |A +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+Info | | | | | |T +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+Expr | | | | XXX | |E +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+Hist | | | | | XXX |+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+What is a \"system\"?Some protocols are particular to hosts and some to gateways; a fewprotocols are used in both. The definitions of the terms belowwill refer to a \"system\" which is either a host or a gateway (orboth). It should be clear from the context of the particularprotocol which types of systems are intended.4.1. Definitions of Protocol StateEvery protocol listed in this document is assigned to a \"maturitylevel\" or STATE of standardization: \"standard\", \"draft standard\",\"proposed standard\", \"experimental\", or \"historic\".4.1.1. Standard ProtocolThe IESG has established this as an official standard protocol forthe Internet. These protocols are assigned STD numbers (see RFC-1311). These are separated into two groups: (1) IP protocol andabove, protocols that apply to the whole Internet; and (2)network-specific protocols, generally specifications of how to doIP on particular types of networks.4.1.2. Draft Standard ProtocolThe IESG is actively considering this protocol as a possibleStandard Protocol. Substantial and widespread testing and commentare desired. Comments and test results should be submitted to theIESG. There is a possibility that changes will be made in a DraftStandard Protocol before it becomes a Standard Protocol.4.1.3. Proposed Standard ProtocolThese are protocol proposals that may be considered by the IESGfor standardization in the future. Implementation and testing byseveral groups is desirable. Revision of the protocolspecification is likely.4.1.4. Experimental ProtocolA system should not implement an experimental protocol unless itis participating in the experiment and has coordinated its use ofthe protocol with the developer of the protocol.Typically, experimental protocols are those that are developed aspart of an ongoing research project not related to an operationalservice offering. While they may be proposed as a serviceprotocol at a later stage, and thus become proposed standard,draft standard, and then standard protocols, the designation of aprotocol as experimental may sometimes be meant to suggest thatthe protocol, although perhaps mature, is not intended foroperational use.4.1.5. Informational ProtocolProtocols developed by other standard organizations, or vendors,or that are for other reasons outside the purview of the IESG, maybe published as RFCs for the convenience of the Internet communityas informational protocols.4.1.6. Historic ProtocolThese are protocols that are unlikely to ever become standards inthe Internet either because they have been superseded by laterdevelopments or due to lack of interest.4.2. Definitions of Protocol StatusThis document lists a \"requirement level\" or STATUS for eachprotocol. The status is one of \"required\", \"recommended\",\"elective\", \"limited use\", or \"not recommended\".4.2.1. Required ProtocolA system must implement the required protocols.4.2.2. Recommended ProtocolA system should implement the recommended protocols.4.2.3. Elective ProtocolA system may or may not implement an elective protocol. Thegeneral notion is that if you are going to do something like this,you must do exactly this. There may be several elective protocolsin a general area, for example, there are several electronic mailprotocols, and several routing protocols.4.2.4. Limited Use ProtocolThese protocols are for use in limited circumstances. This may bebecause of their experimental state, specialized nature, limitedfunctionality, or historic state.4.2.5. Not Recommended ProtocolThese protocols are not recommended for general use. This may bebecause of their limited functionality, specialized nature, orexperimental or historic state.5. The Standards TrackThis section discusses in more detail the procedures used by the RFCEditor and the IESG in making decisions about the labeling andpublishing of protocols as standards.5.1. The RFC Processing Decision TableHere is the current decision table for processing submissions by theRFC Editor. The processing depends on who submitted it, and thestatus they want it to have.+==========================================================+|**************| S O U R C E |+==========================================================+| Desired | IAB | IESG | IRSG | Other || Status | | | | |+==========================================================+| | | | | || Standard | Bogus | Publish | Bogus | Bogus || or | (2) | (1) | (2) | (2) || Draft | | | | || Standard | | | | |+--------------+----------+----------+----------+----------+| | | | | || | Refer | Publish | Refer | Refer || Proposed | (3) | (1) | (3) | (3) || Standard | | | | || | | | | |+--------------+----------+----------+----------+----------+| | | | | || | Notify | Publish | Notify | Notify || Experimental | (4) | (1) | (4) | (4) || Protocol | | | | || | | | | |+--------------+----------+----------+----------+----------+| | | | | || Information | Publish | Publish |Discretion|Discretion|| or Opinion | (1) | (1) | (5) | (5) || Paper | | | | || | | | | |+==========================================================+(1) Publish.(2) Bogus.

Documents fromArea Directors or Working Group Chairs may be considered in the sameway as documents from \"other\".5.2. The Standards Track DiagramThere is a part of the STATUS and STATE categorization that is calledthe standards track. Actually, only the changes of state aresignificant to the progression along the standards track, though thestatus assignments may change as well.The states illustrated by single line boxes are temporary states,those illustrated by double line boxes are long term states. Aprotocol will normally be expected to remain in a temporary state forseveral months (minimum six months for proposed standard, minimumfour months for draft standard). A protocol may be in a long termstate for many years.A protocol may enter the standards track only on the recommendationof the IESG; and may move from one state to another along the trackonly on the recommendation of the IESG. That is, it takes action bythe IESG to either start a protocol on the track or to move it along.Generally, as the protocol enters the standards track a decision ismade as to the eventual STATUS, requirement level or applicability(elective, recommended, or required) the protocol will have, althougha somewhat less stringent current status may be assigned, and it thenis placed in the the proposed standard STATE with that status. Sothe initial placement of a protocol is into state 1. At any time theSTATUS decision may be revisited.|+<----------------------------------------------+| ^V 0 | 4+-----------+ +===========+| enter |-->----------------+-------------->|experiment |+-----------+ | +=====+=====+| |V 1 |+-----------+ V| proposed |-------------->++--->+-----+-----+ || | || V 2 |+<---+-----+-----+ V| draft std |-------------->++--->+-----+-----+ || | || V 3 |+<---+=====+=====+ V| standard |-------------->++=====+=====+ ||V 5+=====+=====+| historic |+===========+The transition from proposed standard (1) to draft standard (2) canonly be by action of the IESG and only after the protocol has beenproposed standard (1) for at least six months.The transition from draft standard (2) to standard (3) can only be byaction of the IESG and only after the protocol has been draftstandard (2) for at least four months.Occasionally, the decision may be that the protocol is not ready forstandardization and will be assigned to the experimental state (4).This is off the standards track, and the protocol may be resubmittedto enter the standards track after further work. There are otherpaths into the experimental and historic states that do not involveIESG action.Sometimes one protocol is replaced by another and thus becomeshistoric, or it may happen that a protocol on the standards track isin a sense overtaken by another protocol (or other events) andbecomes historic (state 5).6.

The host interface has beenstandardized in RFC-1112; however, multicast-routing gateways are inthe experimental stage and are not widely available. An Internethost should support all of RFC-1112, except for the IGMP protocolitself which is optional; see RFC-1122 for more details. Evenwithout IGMP, implementation of RFC-1112 will provide an importantadvance: IP-layer access to local network multicast addressing. Itis expected that IGMP will become recommended for all hosts andgateways at some future date.SMI, MIB-II SNMP -- The Internet Architecture Board recommends thatall IP and TCP implementations be network manageable. At the currenttime, this implies implementation of the Internet MIB-II (RFC-1213),and at least the recommended management protocol SNMP (RFC-1157).RIP -- The Routing Information Protocol (RIP) is widely implementedand used in the Internet. However, both implementors and usersshould be aware that RIP has some serious technical limitations as arouting protocol. The IETF is currently developing severalcandidates for a new standard \"open\" routing protocol with betterproperties than RIP. The IAB urges the Internet community to trackthese developments, and to implement the new protocol when it isstandardized; improved Internet service will result for many users.TP-TCP -- As OSI protocols become more widely implemented and used,there will be an increasing need to support interoperation with theTCP/IP protocols. The Internet Engineering Task Force is formulatingstrategies for interoperation. RFC-1006 provides one interoperationmode, in which TCP/IP is used to emulate TP0 in order to support OSIapplications. Hosts that wish to run OSI connection-orientedapplications in this mode should use the procedure described in RFC-1006. In the future, the IAB expects that a major portion of theInternet will support both TCP/IP and OSI (inter-)network protocolsin parallel, and it will then be possible to run OSI applicationsacross the Internet using full OSI protocol \"stacks\".6.3.

Obsolete ProtocolsSome of the protocols listed in this memo are described in RFCs that areobsoleted by newer RFCs. \"Obsolete\" or \"obsoleted\" is not an officialstate or status of protocols. This subsection is for information only.While it may seem to be obviously wrong to have an obsoleted RFC in thelist of standards, there may be cases when an older standard is in theprocess of being replaced. This process may take a year or two.For example, the Network Time Protocol (NTP) [RFC 1119] is in itsversion 2 a full Standard, and in its version 3 is a Draft Standard [RFC1305]. Once version 3 is a full Standard, version 2 will be madeHistoric.Many obsoleted protocols are of little interest and are dropped fromthis memo altogether. Some obsoleted protocols have received enoughrecognition that it seems appropriate to list them under their currentstatus and with the following reference to their current replacement.RFC RFC Status Title *==== ==== ========= =================================== =1305 obsoletes 1119 Std /Rec Network Time Protocol (Version 2)1533 obsoletes 1497 Draft/Rec Bootstrap Protocol1331 obsoletes 1171 Draft/Ele Point to Point Protocol1574 obsoletes 1139 Prop /Ele Echo for ISO-84731573 obsoletes 1229 Prop /Ele Extensions to the Generic-IF MIB1559 obsoletes 1289 Prop /Ele DECNET MIB1548 obsoletes 1331 Prop /Ele Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP)1541 obsoletes 1531 Prop /Ele Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol1592 obsoletes 1228 Exper/Lim SNMP Distributed Program Interface1528 obsoletes 1486 Exper/Lim An Experiment in Remote Printing1320 obsoletes 1186 Info / MD4 Message Digest Algorithm1057 obsoletes 1050 Hist /Not Remote Procedure Call Version 11421 obsoletes 1113 Hist /Not Mail Privacy: Procedures1422 obsoletes 1114 Hist /Not Mail Privacy: Key Management1423 obsoletes 1115 Hist /Not Mail Privacy: Algorithms1267 obsoletes 1163 Hist /Not Border Gateway Protocol1268 obsoletes 1164 Hist /Not Border Gateway ProtocolThanks to Lynn Wheeler of Britton Lee for compiling the information inthis subsection.[Note: an asterisk at the end of a line indicates a change from theprevious edition of this document.]7.

The Standardization Process\\n\\n   The Internet Architecture Board maintains this list of documents that\\n   define standards for the Internet protocol suite.  See RFC-1601 for\\n   the charter of the IAB and RFC-1160 for an explanation of the role\\n   and organization of the IAB and its subsidiary groups, the Internet\\n   Engineering Task Force (IETF) and the Internet Research Task Force\\n   (IRTF).  Each of these groups has a steering group called the IESG\\n   and IRSG, respectively.  The IETF develops these standards with the\\n   goal of co-ordinating the evolution of the Internet protocols; this\\n   co-ordination has become quite important as the Internet protocols\\n   are increasingly in general commercial use.  The definitive\\n   description of the Internet standards process is found in RFC-1602.\\n\\n   The majority of Internet protocol development and standardization\\n   activity takes place in the working groups of the IETF.\\n\\n   Protocols which are to become standards in the Internet go through a\\n   series of states or maturity levels (proposed standard, draft\\n   standard, and standard) involving increasing amounts of scrutiny and\\n   testing.  When a protocol completes this process it is assigned a STD\\n   number (see RFC-1311).  At each step, the Internet Engineering\\n   Steering Group (IESG) of the IETF must make a recommendation for\\n   advancement of the protocol.\\n\\n   To allow time for the Internet community to consider and react to\\n   standardization proposals, a minimum delay of 6 months before a\\n   proposed standard can be advanced to a draft standard and 4 months\\n   before a draft standard can be promoted to standard.\\n\\n   It is general practice that no proposed standard can be promoted to\\n   draft standard without at least two independent implementations (and\\n   the recommendation of the IESG).  Promotion from draft standard to\\n   standard generally requires operational experience and demonstrated\\n   interoperability of two or more implementations (and the\\n   recommendation of the IESG).\\n\\n   In cases where there is uncertainty as to the proper decision\\n   concerning a protocol a special review committee may be appointed\\n   consisting of experts from the IETF, IRTF and the IAB with the\\n   purpose of recommending an explicit action.\\n\\n   Advancement of a protocol to proposed standard is an important step\\n   since it marks a protocol as a candidate for eventual standardization\\n   (it puts the protocol \"on the standards track\").  Advancement to\\n   draft standard is a major step which warns the community that, unless\\n   major objections are raised or flaws are discovered, the protocol is\\n   likely to be advanced to standard in six months.\\n\\n\\n\\nInternet Architecture Board                                     [Page 3]\\n\\x0c\\nRFC 1720                   Internet Standards              November 1994\\n\\n\\n   Some protocols have been superseded by better ones or are otherwise\\n   unused.  Such protocols are still documented in this memorandum with\\n   the designation \"historic\".\\n\\n   Because it is useful to document the results of early protocol\\n   research and development work, some of the RFCs document protocols\\n   which are still in an experimental condition.  The protocols are\\n   designated \"experimental\" in this memorandum.  They appear in this\\n   report as a convenience to the community and not as evidence of their\\n   standardization.\\n\\n   Other protocols, such as those developed by other standards\\n   organizations, or by particular vendors, may be of interest or may be\\n   recommended for use in the Internet.  The specifications of such\\n   protocols may be published as RFCs for the convenience of the\\n   Internet community.  These protocols are labeled \"informational\" in\\n   this memorandum.\\n\\n   In addition to the working groups of the IETF, protocol development\\n   and experimentation may take place as a result of the work of the\\n   research groups of the Internet Research Task Force, or the work of\\n   other individuals interested in Internet protocol development.  The\\n   the documentation of such experimental work in the RFC series is\\n   encouraged, but none of this work is considered to be on the track\\n   for standardization until the IESG has made a recommendation to\\n   advance the protocol to the proposed standard state.\\n\\n   A few protocols have achieved widespread implementation without the\\n   approval of the IESG.  For example, some vendor protocols have become\\n   very important to the Internet community even though they have not\\n   been recommended by the IESG.  However, the IAB strongly recommends\\n   that the standards process be used in the evolution of the protocol\\n   suite to maximize interoperability (and to prevent incompatible\\n   protocol requirements from arising).  The use of the terms\\n   \"standard\", \"draft standard\", and \"proposed standard\" are reserved in\\n   any RFC or other publication of Internet protocols to only those\\n   protocols which the IESG has approved.\\n\\n   In addition to a state (like \"Proposed Standard\"), a protocol is also\\n   assigned a status, or requirement level, in this document.  The\\n   possible requirement levels (\"Required\", \"Recommended\", \"Elective\",\\n   \"Limited Use\", and \"Not Recommended\") are defined in Section 4.2.\\n   When a protocol is on the standards track, that is in the proposed\\n   standard, draft standard, or standard state (see Section 5), the\\n   status shown in Section 6 is the current status.\\n\\n   Few protocols are required to be implemented in all systems; this is\\n   because there is such a variety of possible systems, for example,\\n\\n\\n\\nInternet Architecture Board                                     [Page 4]\\n\\x0c\\nRFC 1720                   Internet Standards              November 1994\\n\\n\\n   gateways, routers, terminal servers, workstations, and multi-user\\n   hosts.  The requirement level shown in this document is only a one\\n   word label, which may not be sufficient to characterize the\\n   implementation requirements for a protocol in all situations.  For\\n   some protocols, this document contains an additional status paragraph\\n   (an applicability statement).  In addition, more detailed status\\n   information may be contained in separate requirements documents (see\\n   Section 3).\\n\\n2.  The Request for Comments Documents\\n\\n   The documents called Request for Comments (or RFCs) are the working\\n   notes of the \"Network Working Group\", that is the Internet research\\n   and development community.  A document in this series may be on\\n   essentially any topic related to computer communication, and may be\\n   anything from a meeting report to the specification of a standard.\\n\\n   Notice:\\n\\n      All standards are published as RFCs, but not all RFCs specify\\n      standards.\\n\\n   Anyone can submit a document for publication as an RFC.  Submissions\\n   must be made via electronic mail to the RFC Editor (see the contact\\n   information at the end of this memo, and see RFC 1543).\\n\\n   While RFCs are not refereed publications, they do receive technical\\n   review from the task forces, individual technical experts, or the RFC\\n   Editor, as appropriate.\\n\\n   The RFC series comprises a wide range of documents, ranging from\\n   informational documents of general interests to specifications of\\n   standard Internet protocols.  In cases where submission is intended\\n   to document a proposed standard, draft standard, or standard\\n   protocol, the RFC Editor will publish the document only with the\\n   approval of the IESG.  For documents describing experimental work,\\n   the RFC Editor will notify the IESG before publication, allowing for\\n   the possibility of review by the relevant IETF working group or IRTF\\n   research group and provide those comments to the author.  See Section\\n   5.1 for more detail.\\n\\n   Once a document is assigned an RFC number and published, that RFC is\\n   never revised or re-issued with the same number.  There is never a\\n   question of having the most recent version of a particular RFC.\\n   However, a protocol (such as File Transfer Protocol (FTP)) may be\\n   improved and re-documented many times in several different RFCs.  It\\n   is important to verify that you have the most recent RFC on a\\n   particular protocol.  This \"Internet Official Protocol Standards\"\\n\\n\\n\\nInternet Architecture Board                                     [Page 5]\\n\\x0c\\nRFC 1720                   Internet Standards              November 1994\\n\\n\\n   memo is the reference for determining the correct RFC for the current\\n   specification of each protocol.\\n\\n   The RFCs are available from the INTERNIC, and a number of other\\n   sites.  For more information about obtaining RFCs, see Sections 7.4\\n   and 7.5.\\n\\n3.  Other Reference Documents\\n\\n   There are three other reference documents of interest in checking the\\n   current status of protocol specifications and standardization.  These\\n   are the Assigned Numbers, the Gateway Requirements, and the Host\\n   Requirements.  Note that these documents are revised and updated at\\n   different times; in case of differences between these documents, the\\n   most recent must prevail.\\n\\n   Also, one should be aware of the MIL-STD publications on IP, TCP,\\n   Telnet, FTP, and SMTP.  These are described in Section 3.4.\\n\\n3.1.  Assigned Numbers\\n\\n   The \"Assigned Numbers\" document lists the assigned values of the\\n   parameters used in the various protocols.  For example, IP protocol\\n   codes, TCP port numbers, Telnet Option Codes, ARP hardware types, and\\n   Terminal Type names.  Assigned Numbers was most recently issued as\\n   RFC-1700.\\n\\n3.2.  Gateway Requirements\\n\\n   This document reviews the specifications that apply to gateways and\\n   supplies guidance and clarification for any ambiguities.  Gateway\\n   Requirements is RFC-1009.  A working group of the IETF is actively\\n   preparing a revision.\\n\\n3.3.  Host Requirements\\n\\n   This pair of documents reviews and updates the specifications that\\n   apply to hosts, and it supplies guidance and clarification for any\\n   ambiguities.  Host Requirements was issued as RFC-1122 and RFC-1123.\\n\\n3.4.  The MIL-STD Documents\\n\\n   The Internet community specifications for IP (RFC-791) and TCP (RFC-\\n   793) and the DoD MIL-STD specifications are intended to describe\\n   exactly the same protocols.  Any difference in the protocols\\n   specified by these sets of documents should be reported to DISA and\\n   to the IESG.  The RFCs and the MIL-STDs for IP and TCP differ in\\n   style and level of detail.  It is strongly advised that the two sets\\n\\n\\n\\nInternet Architecture Board                                     [Page 6]\\n\\x0c\\nRFC 1720                   Internet Standards              November 1994\\n\\n\\n   of documents be used together, along with RFC-1122 and RFC-1123.\\n\\n   The Internet and the DoD MIL-STD specifications for the FTP, SMTP,\\n   and Telnet protocols are essentially the same documents (RFCs 765,\\n   821, 854).  The MIL-STD versions have been edited slightly.  Note\\n   that the current Internet specification for FTP is RFC-959 (as\\n   modified by RFC-1123).\\n\\n   Note that these MIL-STD are now somewhat out of date.  The Gateway\\n   Requirements (RFC-1009) and Host Requirements (RFC-1122, RFC-1123)\\n   take precedence over both earlier RFCs and the MIL-STDs.\\n\\n          Internet Protocol (IP)                      MIL-STD-1777\\n          Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)         MIL-STD-1778\\n          File Transfer Protocol (FTP)                MIL-STD-1780\\n          Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)        MIL-STD-1781\\n          Telnet Protocol and Options (TELNET)        MIL-STD-1782\\n\\n   These documents are available from the Naval Publications and Forms\\n   Center.

Explanation of Terms\\n\\n   There are two independent categorization of protocols.  The first is\\n   the \"maturity level\" or STATE of standardization, one of \"standard\",\\n   \"draft standard\", \"proposed standard\", \"experimental\",\\n   \"informational\" or \"historic\".  The second is the \"requirement level\"\\n   or STATUS of this protocol, one of \"required\", \"recommended\",\\n   \"elective\", \"limited use\", or \"not recommended\".\\n\\n   The status or requirement level is difficult to portray in a one word\\n   label.  These status labels should be considered only as an\\n   indication, and a further description, or applicability statement,\\n   should be consulted.\\n\\n   When a protocol is advanced to proposed standard or draft standard,\\n   it is labeled with a current status.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nInternet Architecture Board                                     [Page 7]\\n\\x0c\\nRFC 1720                   Internet Standards              November 1994\\n\\n\\n   At any given time a protocol occupies a cell of the following matrix.\\n   Protocols are likely to be in cells in about the following\\n   proportions (indicated by the relative number of Xs).  A new protocol\\n   is most likely to start in the (proposed standard, elective) cell, or\\n   the (experimental, not recommended) cell.\\n\\n                             S T A T U S\\n                     Req   Rec   Ele   Lim   Not\\n                   +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+\\n           Std     |  X  | XXX | XXX |     |     |\\n       S           +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+\\n           Draft   |  X  |  X  | XXX |     |     |\\n       T           +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+\\n           Prop    |     |  X  | XXX |     |     |\\n       A           +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+\\n           Info    |     |     |     |     |     |\\n       T           +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+\\n           Expr    |     |     |     | XXX |     |\\n       E           +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+\\n           Hist    |     |     |     |     | XXX |\\n                   +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+\\n\\n   What is a \"system\"?\\n\\n      Some protocols are particular to hosts and some to gateways; a few\\n      protocols are used in both.  The definitions of the terms below\\n      will refer to a \"system\" which is either a host or a gateway (or\\n      both).  It should be clear from the context of the particular\\n      protocol which types of systems are intended.\\n\\n4.1.  Definitions of Protocol State\\n\\n   Every protocol listed in this document is assigned to a \"maturity\\n   level\" or STATE of standardization: \"standard\", \"draft standard\",\\n   \"proposed standard\", \"experimental\", or \"historic\".\\n\\n   4.1.1.  Standard Protocol\\n\\n      The IESG has established this as an official standard protocol for\\n      the Internet.  These protocols are assigned STD numbers (see RFC-\\n      1311).  These are separated into two groups: (1) IP protocol and\\n      above, protocols that apply to the whole Internet; and (2)\\n      network-specific protocols, generally specifications of how to do\\n      IP on particular types of networks.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nInternet Architecture Board                                     [Page 8]\\n\\x0c\\nRFC 1720                   Internet Standards              November 1994\\n\\n\\n   4.1.2.  Draft Standard Protocol\\n\\n      The IESG is actively considering this protocol as a possible\\n      Standard Protocol.  Substantial and widespread testing and comment\\n      are desired.  Comments and test results should be submitted to the\\n      IESG.  There is a possibility that changes will be made in a Draft\\n      Standard Protocol before it becomes a Standard Protocol.\\n\\n   4.1.3.  Proposed Standard Protocol\\n\\n      These are protocol proposals that may be considered by the IESG\\n      for standardization in the future.  Implementation and testing by\\n      several groups is desirable.  Revision of the protocol\\n      specification is likely.\\n\\n   4.1.4.  Experimental Protocol\\n\\n      A system should not implement an experimental protocol unless it\\n      is participating in the experiment and has coordinated its use of\\n      the protocol with the developer of the protocol.\\n\\n      Typically, experimental protocols are those that are developed as\\n      part of an ongoing research project not related to an operational\\n      service offering.  While they may be proposed as a service\\n      protocol at a later stage, and thus become proposed standard,\\n      draft standard, and then standard protocols, the designation of a\\n      protocol as experimental may sometimes be meant to suggest that\\n      the protocol, although perhaps mature, is not intended for\\n      operational use.\\n\\n   4.1.5.  Informational Protocol\\n\\n      Protocols developed by other standard organizations, or vendors,\\n      or that are for other reasons outside the purview of the IESG, may\\n      be published as RFCs for the convenience of the Internet community\\n      as informational protocols.\\n\\n   4.1.6.  Historic Protocol\\n\\n      These are protocols that are unlikely to ever become standards in\\n      the Internet either because they have been superseded by later\\n      developments or due to lack of interest.\\n\\n4.2.  Definitions of Protocol Status\\n\\n      This document lists a \"requirement level\" or STATUS for each\\n      protocol.  The status is one of \"required\", \"recommended\",\\n      \"elective\", \"limited use\", or \"not recommended\".\\n\\n\\n\\nInternet Architecture Board                                     [Page 9]\\n\\x0c\\nRFC 1720                   Internet Standards              November 1994\\n\\n\\n   4.2.1.  Required Protocol\\n\\n      A system must implement the required protocols.\\n\\n   4.2.2.  Recommended Protocol\\n\\n      A system should implement the recommended protocols.\\n\\n   4.2.3.  Elective Protocol\\n\\n      A system may or may not implement an elective protocol. The\\n      general notion is that if you are going to do something like this,\\n      you must do exactly this.  There may be several elective protocols\\n      in a general area, for example, there are several electronic mail\\n      protocols, and several routing protocols.\\n\\n   4.2.4.  Limited Use Protocol\\n\\n      These protocols are for use in limited circumstances.  This may be\\n      because of their experimental state, specialized nature, limited\\n      functionality, or historic state.\\n\\n   4.2.5.  Not Recommended Protocol\\n\\n      These protocols are not recommended for general use.  This may be\\n      because of their limited functionality, specialized nature, or\\n      experimental or historic state.\\n\\n5.  The Standards Track\\n\\n   This section discusses in more detail the procedures used by the RFC\\n   Editor and the IESG in making decisions about the labeling and\\n   publishing of protocols as standards.\\n\\n5.1.  The RFC Processing Decision Table\\n\\n   Here is the current decision table for processing submissions by the\\n   RFC Editor.

The Standards Track Diagram\\n\\n   There is a part of the STATUS and STATE categorization that is called\\n   the standards track.  Actually, only the changes of state are\\n   significant to the progression along the standards track, though the\\n   status assignments may change as well.\\n\\n   The states illustrated by single line boxes are temporary states,\\n   those illustrated by double line boxes are long term states.  A\\n   protocol will normally be expected to remain in a temporary state for\\n   several months (minimum six months for proposed standard, minimum\\n   four months for draft standard).  A protocol may be in a long term\\n   state for many years.\\n\\n   A protocol may enter the standards track only on the recommendation\\n   of the IESG; and may move from one state to another along the track\\n   only on the recommendation of the IESG.  That is, it takes action by\\n   the IESG to either start a protocol on the track or to move it along.\\n\\n   Generally, as the protocol enters the standards track a decision is\\n   made as to the eventual STATUS, requirement level or applicability\\n   (elective, recommended, or required) the protocol will have, although\\n   a somewhat less stringent current status may be assigned, and it then\\n   is placed in the the proposed standard STATE with that status.  So\\n   the initial placement of a protocol is into state 1.  At any time the\\n   STATUS decision may be revisited.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nInternet Architecture Board                                    [Page 12]\\n\\x0c\\nRFC 1720                   Internet Standards              November 1994\\n\\n\\n         |\\n         +<----------------------------------------------+\\n         |                                               ^\\n         V    0                                          |    4\\n   +-----------+                                   +===========+\\n   |   enter   |-->----------------+-------------->|experiment |\\n   +-----------+                   |               +=====+=====+\\n                                   |                     |\\n                                   V    1                |\\n                             +-----------+               V\\n                             | proposed  |-------------->+\\n                        +--->+-----+-----+               |\\n                        |          |                     |\\n                        |          V    2                |\\n                        +<---+-----+-----+               V\\n                             | draft std |-------------->+\\n                        +--->+-----+-----+               |\\n                        |          |                     |\\n                        |          V    3                |\\n                        +<---+=====+=====+               V\\n                             | standard  |-------------->+\\n                             +=====+=====+               |\\n                                                         |\\n                                                         V    5\\n                                                   +=====+=====+\\n                                                   | historic  |\\n                                                   +===========+\\n\\n   The transition from proposed standard (1) to draft standard (2) can\\n   only be by action of the IESG and only after the protocol has been\\n   proposed standard (1) for at least six months.\\n\\n   The transition from draft standard (2) to standard (3) can only be by\\n   action of the IESG and only after the protocol has been draft\\n   standard (2) for at least four months.\\n\\n   Occasionally, the decision may be that the protocol is not ready for\\n   standardization and will be assigned to the experimental state (4).\\n   This is off the standards track, and the protocol may be resubmitted\\n   to enter the standards track after further work.  There are other\\n   paths into the experimental and historic states that do not involve\\n   IESG action.\\n\\n   Sometimes one protocol is replaced by another and thus becomes\\n   historic, or it may happen that a protocol on the standards track is\\n   in a sense overtaken by another protocol (or other events) and\\n   becomes historic (state 5).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nInternet Architecture Board                                    [Page 13]\\n\\x0c\\nRFC 1720                   Internet Standards              November 1994\\n\\n\\n6.

The host interface has been\\n   standardized in RFC-1112; however, multicast-routing gateways are in\\n   the experimental stage and are not widely available.  An Internet\\n   host should support all of RFC-1112, except for the IGMP protocol\\n   itself which is optional; see RFC-1122 for more details.  Even\\n   without IGMP, implementation of RFC-1112 will provide an important\\n   advance: IP-layer access to local network multicast addressing.  It\\n   is expected that IGMP will become recommended for all hosts and\\n   gateways at some future date.\\n\\n   SMI, MIB-II SNMP -- The Internet Architecture Board recommends that\\n   all IP and TCP implementations be network manageable.  At the current\\n   time, this implies implementation of the Internet MIB-II (RFC-1213),\\n   and at least the recommended management protocol SNMP (RFC-1157).\\n\\n   RIP -- The Routing Information Protocol (RIP) is widely implemented\\n   and used in the Internet.  However, both implementors and users\\n   should be aware that RIP has some serious technical limitations as a\\n   routing protocol.  The IETF is currently developing several\\n   candidates for a new standard \"open\" routing protocol with better\\n   properties than RIP.  The IAB urges the Internet community to track\\n   these developments, and to implement the new protocol when it is\\n   standardized; improved Internet service will result for many users.\\n\\n   TP-TCP -- As OSI protocols become more widely implemented and used,\\n   there will be an increasing need to support interoperation with the\\n   TCP/IP protocols.  The Internet Engineering Task Force is formulating\\n   strategies for interoperation.  RFC-1006 provides one interoperation\\n   mode, in which TCP/IP is used to emulate TP0 in order to support OSI\\n   applications.  Hosts that wish to run OSI connection-oriented\\n   applications in this mode should use the procedure described in RFC-\\n   1006.  In the future, the IAB expects that a major portion of the\\n   Internet will support both TCP/IP and OSI (inter-)network protocols\\n   in parallel, and it will then be possible to run OSI applications\\n   across the Internet using full OSI protocol \"stacks\".\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nInternet Architecture Board                                    [Page 25]\\n\\x0c\\nRFC 1720                   Internet Standards              November 1994\\n\\n\\n6.3.

This subsection is for information only.\\n\\nWhile it may seem to be obviously wrong to have an obsoleted RFC in the\\nlist of standards, there may be cases when an older standard is in the\\nprocess of being replaced.  This process may take a year or two.\\n\\nFor example, the Network Time Protocol (NTP) [RFC 1119] is in its\\nversion 2 a full Standard, and in its version 3 is a Draft Standard [RFC\\n1305].  Once version 3 is a full Standard, version 2 will be made\\nHistoric.\\n\\nMany obsoleted protocols are of little interest and are dropped from\\nthis memo altogether.  Some obsoleted protocols have received enough\\nrecognition that it seems appropriate to list them under their current\\nstatus and with the following reference to their current replacement.\\n\\nRFC            RFC   Status     Title                               *\\n====           ====  =========  =================================== =\\n1305 obsoletes 1119  Std  /Rec  Network Time Protocol (Version 2)\\n1533 obsoletes 1497  Draft/Rec  Bootstrap Protocol\\n1331 obsoletes 1171  Draft/Ele  Point to Point Protocol\\n1574 obsoletes 1139  Prop /Ele  Echo for ISO-8473\\n1573 obsoletes 1229  Prop /Ele  Extensions to the Generic-IF MIB\\n1559 obsoletes 1289  Prop /Ele  DECNET MIB\\n1548 obsoletes 1331  Prop /Ele  Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP)\\n1541 obsoletes 1531  Prop /Ele  Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol\\n1592 obsoletes 1228  Exper/Lim  SNMP Distributed Program Interface\\n1528 obsoletes 1486  Exper/Lim  An Experiment in Remote Printing\\n1320 obsoletes 1186  Info /     MD4 Message Digest Algorithm\\n1057 obsoletes 1050  Hist /Not  Remote Procedure Call Version 1\\n1421 obsoletes 1113  Hist /Not  Mail Privacy: Procedures\\n1422 obsoletes 1114  Hist /Not  Mail Privacy: Key Management\\n1423 obsoletes 1115  Hist /Not  Mail Privacy: Algorithms\\n1267 obsoletes 1163  Hist /Not  Border Gateway Protocol\\n1268 obsoletes 1164  Hist /Not  Border Gateway Protocol\\n\\nThanks to Lynn Wheeler of Britton Lee for compiling the information in\\nthis subsection.\\n\\n[Note: an asterisk at the end of a line indicates a change from the\\nprevious edition of this document.]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nInternet Architecture Board                                    [Page 36]\\n\\x0c\\nRFC 1720                   Internet Standards              November 1994\\n\\n\\n7.

Finally are pointers to references and contacts forfurther information.This memo is intended to be issued approximately quarterly; please besure the copy you are reading is current. Current copies may beobtained from the Network Information Center (INTERNIC) or from theInternet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) (see the contactinformation at the end of this memo). Do not use this edition after1-Mar-95.See Section 6.1 for a description of recent changes. In the officiallists in sections 6.2 - 6.10, an asterisk (*) next to a protocoldenotes that it is new to this document or has been moved from oneprotocol level to another, or differs from the previous edition ofthis document.1. The Standardization ProcessThe Internet Architecture Board maintains this list of documents thatdefine standards for the Internet protocol suite. See RFC-1601 forthe charter of the IAB and RFC-1160 for an explanation of the roleand organization of the IAB and its subsidiary groups, the InternetEngineering Task Force (IETF) and the Internet Research Task Force(IRTF). Each of these groups has a steering group called the IESGand IRSG, respectively. The IETF develops these standards with thegoal of co-ordinating the evolution of the Internet protocols; thisco-ordination has become quite important as the Internet protocolsare increasingly in general commercial use. The definitivedescription of the Internet standards process is found in RFC-1602.The majority of Internet protocol development and standardizationactivity takes place in the working groups of the IETF.Protocols which are to become standards in the Internet go through aseries of states or maturity levels (proposed standard, draftstandard, and standard) involving increasing amounts of scrutiny andtesting. When a protocol completes this process it is assigned a STDnumber (see RFC-1311). At each step, the Internet EngineeringSteering Group (IESG) of the IETF must make a recommendation foradvancement of the protocol.To allow time for the Internet community to consider and react tostandardization proposals, a minimum delay of 6 months before aproposed standard can be advanced to a draft standard and 4 monthsbefore a draft standard can be promoted to standard.It is general practice that no proposed standard can be promoted todraft standard without at least two independent implementations (andthe recommendation of the IESG). Promotion from draft standard tostandard generally requires operational experience and demonstratedinteroperability of two or more implementations (and therecommendation of the IESG).In cases where there is uncertainty as to the proper decisionconcerning a protocol a special review committee may be appointedconsisting of experts from the IETF, IRTF and the IAB with thepurpose of recommending an explicit action.Advancement of a protocol to proposed standard is an important stepsince it marks a protocol as a candidate for eventual standardization(it puts the protocol \"on the standards track\"). Advancement todraft standard is a major step which warns the community that, unlessmajor objections are raised or flaws are discovered, the protocol islikely to be advanced to standard in six months.Some protocols have been superseded by better ones or are otherwiseunused. Such protocols are still documented in this memorandum withthe designation \"historic\".Because it is useful to document the results of early protocolresearch and development work, some of the RFCs document protocolswhich are still in an experimental condition. The protocols aredesignated \"experimental\" in this memorandum. They appear in thisreport as a convenience to the community and not as evidence of theirstandardization.Other protocols, such as those developed by other standardsorganizations, or by particular vendors, may be of interest or may berecommended for use in the Internet. The specifications of suchprotocols may be published as RFCs for the convenience of theInternet community. These protocols are labeled \"informational\" inthis memorandum.In addition to the working groups of the IETF, protocol developmentand experimentation may take place as a result of the work of theresearch groups of the Internet Research Task Force, or the work ofother individuals interested in Internet protocol development. Thethe documentation of such experimental work in the RFC series isencouraged, but none of this work is considered to be on the trackfor standardization until the IESG has made a recommendation toadvance the protocol to the proposed standard state.A few protocols have achieved widespread implementation without theapproval of the IESG. For example, some vendor protocols have becomevery important to the Internet community even though they have notbeen recommended by the IESG. However, the IAB strongly recommendsthat the standards process be used in the evolution of the protocolsuite to maximize interoperability (and to prevent incompatibleprotocol requirements from arising). The use of the terms\"standard\", \"draft standard\", and \"proposed standard\" are reserved inany RFC or other publication of Internet protocols to only thoseprotocols which the IESG has approved.In addition to a state (like \"Proposed Standard\"), a protocol is alsoassigned a status, or requirement level, in this document. Thepossible requirement levels (\"Required\", \"Recommended\", \"Elective\",\"Limited Use\", and \"Not Recommended\") are defined in Section 4.2.When a protocol is on the standards track, that is in the proposedstandard, draft standard, or standard state (see Section 5), thestatus shown in Section 6 is the current status.Few protocols are required to be implemented in all systems; this isbecause there is such a variety of possible systems, for example,gateways, routers, terminal servers, workstations, and multi-userhosts. The requirement level shown in this document is only a oneword label, which may not be sufficient to characterize theimplementation requirements for a protocol in all situations. Forsome protocols, this document contains an additional status paragraph(an applicability statement). In addition, more detailed statusinformation may be contained in separate requirements documents (seeSection 3).2. The Request for Comments DocumentsThe documents called Request for Comments (or RFCs) are the workingnotes of the \"Network Working Group\", that is the Internet researchand development community. A document in this series may be onessentially any topic related to computer communication, and may beanything from a meeting report to the specification of a standard.Notice:All standards are published as RFCs, but not all RFCs specifystandards.Anyone can submit a document for publication as an RFC. Submissionsmust be made via electronic mail to the RFC Editor (see the contactinformation at the end of this memo, and see RFC 1543).While RFCs are not refereed publications, they do receive technicalreview from the task forces, individual technical experts, or the RFCEditor, as appropriate.The RFC series comprises a wide range of documents, ranging frominformational documents of general interests to specifications ofstandard Internet protocols. In cases where submission is intendedto document a proposed standard, draft standard, or standardprotocol, the RFC Editor will publish the document only with theapproval of the IESG. For documents describing experimental work,the RFC Editor will notify the IESG before publication, allowing forthe possibility of review by the relevant IETF working group or IRTFresearch group and provide those comments to the author. See Section5.1 for more detail.Once a document is assigned an RFC number and published, that RFC isnever revised or re-issued with the same number. There is never aquestion of having the most recent version of a particular RFC.However, a protocol (such as File Transfer Protocol (FTP)) may beimproved and re-documented many times in several different RFCs. Itis important to verify that you have the most recent RFC on aparticular protocol. This \"Internet Official Protocol Standards\"memo is the reference for determining the correct RFC for the currentspecification of each protocol.The RFCs are available from the INTERNIC, and a number of othersites. For more information about obtaining RFCs, see Sections 7.4and 7.5.3. Other Reference DocumentsThere are three other reference documents of interest in checking thecurrent status of protocol specifications and standardization. Theseare the Assigned Numbers, the Gateway Requirements, and the HostRequirements. Note that these documents are revised and updated atdifferent times; in case of differences between these documents, themost recent must prevail.Also, one should be aware of the MIL-STD publications on IP, TCP,Telnet, FTP, and SMTP. These are described in Section 3.4.3.1. Assigned NumbersThe \"Assigned Numbers\" document lists the assigned values of theparameters used in the various protocols. For example, IP protocolcodes, TCP port numbers, Telnet Option Codes, ARP hardware types, andTerminal Type names. Assigned Numbers was most recently issued asRFC-1700.3.2. Gateway RequirementsThis document reviews the specifications that apply to gateways andsupplies guidance and clarification for any ambiguities. GatewayRequirements is RFC-1009. A working group of the IETF is activelypreparing a revision.3.3. Host RequirementsThis pair of documents reviews and updates the specifications thatapply to hosts, and it supplies guidance and clarification for anyambiguities. Host Requirements was issued as RFC-1122 and RFC-1123.3.4. The MIL-STD DocumentsThe Internet community specifications for IP (RFC-791) and TCP (RFC-793) and the DoD MIL-STD specifications are intended to describeexactly the same protocols. Any difference in the protocolsspecified by these sets of documents should be reported to DISA andto the IESG. The RFCs and the MIL-STDs for IP and TCP differ instyle and level of detail. It is strongly advised that the two setsof documents be used together, along with RFC-1122 and RFC-1123.The Internet and the DoD MIL-STD specifications for the FTP, SMTP,and Telnet protocols are essentially the same documents (RFCs 765,821, 854). The MIL-STD versions have been edited slightly. Notethat the current Internet specification for FTP is RFC-959 (asmodified by RFC-1123).Note that these MIL-STD are now somewhat out of date. The GatewayRequirements (RFC-1009) and Host Requirements (RFC-1122, RFC-1123)take precedence over both earlier RFCs and the MIL-STDs.Internet Protocol (IP) MIL-STD-1777Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) MIL-STD-1778File Transfer Protocol (FTP) MIL-STD-1780Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) MIL-STD-1781Telnet Protocol and Options (TELNET) MIL-STD-1782These documents are available from the Naval Publications and FormsCenter.

Explanation of TermsThere are two independent categorization of protocols. The first isthe \"maturity level\" or STATE of standardization, one of \"standard\",\"draft standard\", \"proposed standard\", \"experimental\",\"informational\" or \"historic\". The second is the \"requirement level\"or STATUS of this protocol, one of \"required\", \"recommended\",\"elective\", \"limited use\", or \"not recommended\".The status or requirement level is difficult to portray in a one wordlabel. These status labels should be considered only as anindication, and a further description, or applicability statement,should be consulted.When a protocol is advanced to proposed standard or draft standard,it is labeled with a current status.At any given time a protocol occupies a cell of the following matrix.Protocols are likely to be in cells in about the followingproportions (indicated by the relative number of Xs). A new protocolis most likely to start in the (proposed standard, elective) cell, orthe (experimental, not recommended) cell.S T A T U SReq Rec Ele Lim Not+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+Std | X | XXX | XXX | | |S +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+Draft | X | X | XXX | | |T +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+Prop | | X | XXX | | |A +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+Info | | | | | |T +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+Expr | | | | XXX | |E +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+Hist | | | | | XXX |+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+What is a \"system\"?Some protocols are particular to hosts and some to gateways; a fewprotocols are used in both. The definitions of the terms belowwill refer to a \"system\" which is either a host or a gateway (orboth). It should be clear from the context of the particularprotocol which types of systems are intended.4.1. Definitions of Protocol StateEvery protocol listed in this document is assigned to a \"maturitylevel\" or STATE of standardization: \"standard\", \"draft standard\",\"proposed standard\", \"experimental\", or \"historic\".4.1.1. Standard ProtocolThe IESG has established this as an official standard protocol forthe Internet. These protocols are assigned STD numbers (see RFC-1311). These are separated into two groups: (1) IP protocol andabove, protocols that apply to the whole Internet; and (2)network-specific protocols, generally specifications of how to doIP on particular types of networks.4.1.2. Draft Standard ProtocolThe IESG is actively considering this protocol as a possibleStandard Protocol. Substantial and widespread testing and commentare desired. Comments and test results should be submitted to theIESG. There is a possibility that changes will be made in a DraftStandard Protocol before it becomes a Standard Protocol.4.1.3. Proposed Standard ProtocolThese are protocol proposals that may be considered by the IESGfor standardization in the future. Implementation and testing byseveral groups is desirable. Revision of the protocolspecification is likely.4.1.4. Experimental ProtocolA system should not implement an experimental protocol unless itis participating in the experiment and has coordinated its use ofthe protocol with the developer of the protocol.Typically, experimental protocols are those that are developed aspart of an ongoing research project not related to an operationalservice offering. While they may be proposed as a serviceprotocol at a later stage, and thus become proposed standard,draft standard, and then standard protocols, the designation of aprotocol as experimental may sometimes be meant to suggest thatthe protocol, although perhaps mature, is not intended foroperational use.4.1.5. Informational ProtocolProtocols developed by other standard organizations, or vendors,or that are for other reasons outside the purview of the IESG, maybe published as RFCs for the convenience of the Internet communityas informational protocols.4.1.6. Historic ProtocolThese are protocols that are unlikely to ever become standards inthe Internet either because they have been superseded by laterdevelopments or due to lack of interest.4.2. Definitions of Protocol StatusThis document lists a \"requirement level\" or STATUS for eachprotocol. The status is one of \"required\", \"recommended\",\"elective\", \"limited use\", or \"not recommended\".4.2.1. Required ProtocolA system must implement the required protocols.4.2.2. Recommended ProtocolA system should implement the recommended protocols.4.2.3. Elective ProtocolA system may or may not implement an elective protocol. Thegeneral notion is that if you are going to do something like this,you must do exactly this. There may be several elective protocolsin a general area, for example, there are several electronic mailprotocols, and several routing protocols.4.2.4. Limited Use ProtocolThese protocols are for use in limited circumstances. This may bebecause of their experimental state, specialized nature, limitedfunctionality, or historic state.4.2.5. Not Recommended ProtocolThese protocols are not recommended for general use. This may bebecause of their limited functionality, specialized nature, orexperimental or historic state.5. The Standards TrackThis section discusses in more detail the procedures used by the RFCEditor and the IESG in making decisions about the labeling andpublishing of protocols as standards.5.1. The RFC Processing Decision TableHere is the current decision table for processing submissions by theRFC Editor. The processing depends on who submitted it, and thestatus they want it to have.+==========================================================+|**************| S O U R C E |+==========================================================+| Desired | IAB | IESG | IRSG | Other || Status | | | | |+==========================================================+| | | | | || Standard | Bogus | Publish | Bogus | Bogus || or | (2) | (1) | (2) | (2) || Draft | | | | || Standard | | | | |+--------------+----------+----------+----------+----------+| | | | | || | Refer | Publish | Refer | Refer || Proposed | (3) | (1) | (3) | (3) || Standard | | | | || | | | | |+--------------+----------+----------+----------+----------+| | | | | || | Notify | Publish | Notify | Notify || Experimental | (4) | (1) | (4) | (4) || Protocol | | | | || | | | | |+--------------+----------+----------+----------+----------+| | | | | || Information | Publish | Publish |Discretion|Discretion|| or Opinion | (1) | (1) | (5) | (5) || Paper | | | | || | | | | |+==========================================================+(1) Publish.(2) Bogus.

Documents fromArea Directors or Working Group Chairs may be considered in the sameway as documents from \"other\".5.2. The Standards Track DiagramThere is a part of the STATUS and STATE categorization that is calledthe standards track. Actually, only the changes of state aresignificant to the progression along the standards track, though thestatus assignments may change as well.The states illustrated by single line boxes are temporary states,those illustrated by double line boxes are long term states. Aprotocol will normally be expected to remain in a temporary state forseveral months (minimum six months for proposed standard, minimumfour months for draft standard). A protocol may be in a long termstate for many years.A protocol may enter the standards track only on the recommendationof the IESG; and may move from one state to another along the trackonly on the recommendation of the IESG. That is, it takes action bythe IESG to either start a protocol on the track or to move it along.Generally, as the protocol enters the standards track a decision ismade as to the eventual STATUS, requirement level or applicability(elective, recommended, or required) the protocol will have, althougha somewhat less stringent current status may be assigned, and it thenis placed in the the proposed standard STATE with that status. Sothe initial placement of a protocol is into state 1. At any time theSTATUS decision may be revisited.|+<----------------------------------------------+| ^V 0 | 4+-----------+ +===========+| enter |-->----------------+-------------->|experiment |+-----------+ | +=====+=====+| |V 1 |+-----------+ V| proposed |-------------->++--->+-----+-----+ || | || V 2 |+<---+-----+-----+ V| draft std |-------------->++--->+-----+-----+ || | || V 3 |+<---+=====+=====+ V| standard |-------------->++=====+=====+ ||V 5+=====+=====+| historic |+===========+The transition from proposed standard (1) to draft standard (2) canonly be by action of the IESG and only after the protocol has beenproposed standard (1) for at least six months.The transition from draft standard (2) to standard (3) can only be byaction of the IESG and only after the protocol has been draftstandard (2) for at least four months.Occasionally, the decision may be that the protocol is not ready forstandardization and will be assigned to the experimental state (4).This is off the standards track, and the protocol may be resubmittedto enter the standards track after further work. There are otherpaths into the experimental and historic states that do not involveIESG action.Sometimes one protocol is replaced by another and thus becomeshistoric, or it may happen that a protocol on the standards track isin a sense overtaken by another protocol (or other events) andbecomes historic (state 5).6.

The host interface has beenstandardized in RFC-1112; however, multicast-routing gateways are inthe experimental stage and are not widely available. An Internethost should support all of RFC-1112, except for the IGMP protocolitself which is optional; see RFC-1122 for more details. Evenwithout IGMP, implementation of RFC-1112 will provide an importantadvance: IP-layer access to local network multicast addressing. Itis expected that IGMP will become recommended for all hosts andgateways at some future date.SMI, MIB-II SNMP -- The Internet Architecture Board recommends thatall IP and TCP implementations be network manageable. At the currenttime, this implies implementation of the Internet MIB-II (RFC-1213),and at least the recommended management protocol SNMP (RFC-1157).RIP -- The Routing Information Protocol (RIP) is widely implementedand used in the Internet. However, both implementors and usersshould be aware that RIP has some serious technical limitations as arouting protocol. The IETF is currently developing severalcandidates for a new standard \"open\" routing protocol with betterproperties than RIP. The IAB urges the Internet community to trackthese developments, and to implement the new protocol when it isstandardized; improved Internet service will result for many users.TP-TCP -- As OSI protocols become more widely implemented and used,there will be an increasing need to support interoperation with theTCP/IP protocols. The Internet Engineering Task Force is formulatingstrategies for interoperation. RFC-1006 provides one interoperationmode, in which TCP/IP is used to emulate TP0 in order to support OSIapplications. Hosts that wish to run OSI connection-orientedapplications in this mode should use the procedure described in RFC-1006. In the future, the IAB expects that a major portion of theInternet will support both TCP/IP and OSI (inter-)network protocolsin parallel, and it will then be possible to run OSI applicationsacross the Internet using full OSI protocol \"stacks\".6.3.

Obsolete ProtocolsSome of the protocols listed in this memo are described in RFCs that areobsoleted by newer RFCs. \"Obsolete\" or \"obsoleted\" is not an officialstate or status of protocols. This subsection is for information only.While it may seem to be obviously wrong to have an obsoleted RFC in thelist of standards, there may be cases when an older standard is in theprocess of being replaced. This process may take a year or two.For example, the Network Time Protocol (NTP) [RFC 1119] is in itsversion 2 a full Standard, and in its version 3 is a Draft Standard [RFC1305]. Once version 3 is a full Standard, version 2 will be madeHistoric.Many obsoleted protocols are of little interest and are dropped fromthis memo altogether. Some obsoleted protocols have received enoughrecognition that it seems appropriate to list them under their currentstatus and with the following reference to their current replacement.RFC RFC Status Title *==== ==== ========= =================================== =1305 obsoletes 1119 Std /Rec Network Time Protocol (Version 2)1533 obsoletes 1497 Draft/Rec Bootstrap Protocol1331 obsoletes 1171 Draft/Ele Point to Point Protocol1574 obsoletes 1139 Prop /Ele Echo for ISO-84731573 obsoletes 1229 Prop /Ele Extensions to the Generic-IF MIB1559 obsoletes 1289 Prop /Ele DECNET MIB1548 obsoletes 1331 Prop /Ele Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP)1541 obsoletes 1531 Prop /Ele Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol1592 obsoletes 1228 Exper/Lim SNMP Distributed Program Interface1528 obsoletes 1486 Exper/Lim An Experiment in Remote Printing1320 obsoletes 1186 Info / MD4 Message Digest Algorithm1057 obsoletes 1050 Hist /Not Remote Procedure Call Version 11421 obsoletes 1113 Hist /Not Mail Privacy: Procedures1422 obsoletes 1114 Hist /Not Mail Privacy: Key Management1423 obsoletes 1115 Hist /Not Mail Privacy: Algorithms1267 obsoletes 1163 Hist /Not Border Gateway Protocol1268 obsoletes 1164 Hist /Not Border Gateway ProtocolThanks to Lynn Wheeler of Britton Lee for compiling the information inthis subsection.[Note: an asterisk at the end of a line indicates a change from theprevious edition of this document.]7.
