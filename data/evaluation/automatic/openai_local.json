If there are no address parameters present in the received INIT or INIT ACK chunk, the endpoint MUST take the source IP address from which the chunk arrives and record it, in combination with the SCTP Source Port Number, as the only destination transport address for this peer. If there is a Host Name Address parameter present in the received INIT or INIT ACK chunk, the endpoint MUST immediately send an ABORT chunk and MAY include an 'Unresolvable Address' error cause to its peer. The ABORT chunk SHOULD be sent to the source IP address from which the last peer packet was received. If there are only IPv4\/IPv6 addresses present in the received INIT or INIT ACK chunk, the receiver MUST derive and record all the transport addresses from the received chunk AND the source IP address that sent the INIT or INIT ACK chunk. The transport addresses are derived by the combination of SCTP Source Port Number (from the common header) and the IP Address parameter(s) carried in the INIT or INIT ACK chunk and the source IP address of the IP datagram. The receiver SHOULD use only these transport addresses as destination transport addresses when sending subsequent packets to its peer.

Point-to-point interfaces are used to create direct connections between two nodes, while multi-access interfaces allow multiple nodes to connect to a single link.

In terms of functionality, ACP point-to-point interfaces work by creating an encrypted and authenticated communication channel between two nodes, while ACP multi-access virtual interfaces allow multiple nodes to share this same secure connection.
