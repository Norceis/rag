Finite delay refers to the amount of time it takes for a packet to travel from its source to its destination, while packet loss refers to when a packet is not delivered to its destination due to network issues such as congestion or errors. In general, large packets tend to have more finite delay than small packets, but they are also more susceptible to packet loss.

As stated in [rfc1793], the Point-to-MultiPoint interface type [RFC6845] is used for connecting one device to many other devices. On the other hand, [rfc8014] defines a Virtual Access Point (VAP) that can be configured on a Point-to-Point interface to create a Point-to-MultiPoint connection. Finally, [rfc1770] explains that Point-to-MultiPoint connections are used for connecting multiple devices to one device, and not the other way around.","Retrieved context":[{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_namespace":["langchain","schema","document"],"lc_secrets":{},"lc_serializable":false,"metadata":{"Source":"rfc8994","Title":"An Autonomic Control Plane (ACP)","Updates":null,"Obsoletes":null,"Category":null,"ISSN":[],"Updated by":null,"NIC":[],"Obsoleted by":null,"Related RFCs":null},"page_content":"6.13.5.2.1.
